---> PIE  - Personality Insight Engine

This is PIE â€“ a smart little engine Iâ€™m cooking with Spring Boot.
It tells you what kind of person you seem like based on a few simple questions...
and even throws some advice on what to wear every day based on your income, lifestyle, and mindset.

- Analyzes your personality from a set of behavioral questions
