**** > PIE: Personality Insight Engine
A fusion of behavioral science, modular logic, and elegant engineering.


**** > What is PIE?
PIE (Personality Insight Engine) is a philosophical yet practical backend system crafted with Java and Spring Boot. It delves into human behavioral patterns using structured questions and 
maps them to intelligent attire suggestions — personalized by income, lifestyle, and mindset.

This engine isn't just code. It's a demonstration of how engineering can interface with cognition, how logic can translate into lifestyle, and how philosophy finds expression in software systems.

****> Conceptual Philosophy
PIE is built on the belief that:

>>>> Human behavior, though unpredictable, has mappable patterns

>>>> Insightful questions reveal more than analytics ever could

>>>> A simple suggestion — like what to wear — can echo deeper truths about our daily decisions

****> Built With
Java 17 – Stable, modern, object-oriented foundation

Spring Boot – For clean, modular, production-ready architecture

Maven – Dependency management that keeps everything smooth

IntelliJ IDEA – A space for thought to become software

Git & GitHub – For versioned reflection of evolving insight

****> Features
>>>> Personality profiling using structured behavioral algorithms

>>>> Contextual attire recommendations (not just for fashion — but function and identity)

>>>> Extensible architecture — ready to evolve with future psychological models

>>>> Designed for learners who want to understand Spring Boot beyond tutorials
