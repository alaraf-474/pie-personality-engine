🧠 PIE: Personality Insight Engine
A fusion of behavioral science, modular logic, and elegant engineering.


🔍 What is PIE?
PIE (Personality Insight Engine) is a philosophical yet practical backend system crafted with Java and Spring Boot. It delves into human behavioral patterns using structured questions and 
maps them to intelligent attire suggestions — personalized by income, lifestyle, and mindset.

This engine isn't just code. It's a demonstration of how engineering can interface with cognition, how logic can translate into lifestyle, and how philosophy finds expression in software systems.

🧪 Conceptual Philosophy
PIE is built on the belief that:

🧠 Human behavior, though unpredictable, has mappable patterns

🕵️ Insightful questions reveal more than analytics ever could

🎽 A simple suggestion — like what to wear — can echo deeper truths about our daily decisions

🔧 Built With
Java 17 – Stable, modern, object-oriented foundation

Spring Boot – For clean, modular, production-ready architecture

Maven – Dependency management that keeps everything smooth

IntelliJ IDEA – A space for thought to become software

Git & GitHub – For versioned reflection of evolving insight

🚀 Features
🧬 Personality profiling using structured behavioral algorithms

👕 Contextual attire recommendations (not just for fashion — but function and identity)

🧩 Extensible architecture — ready to evolve with future psychological models

🧑‍💻 Designed for learners who want to understand Spring Boot beyond tutorials

 Closing Thought
"We wear what we are. PIE doesn't choose clothes. It mirrors character."
